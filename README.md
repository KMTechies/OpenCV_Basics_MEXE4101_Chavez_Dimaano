# Use Haar Cascade Face Detection Code to Identify and Highlight BINI Members in a Crowd
## Introduction

  Face detection is one of the key applications of computer vision that allows machines to identify and locate human faces in images or video streams. This technology has been increasingly popular due to its application in security, social media, and human-computer interaction fields. Among the tools available for implementing face detection, OpenCV stands out as a robust and versatile library.

## Abstract

  OpenCV provides several methods for face detection, with the Haar Cascade Classifier being one of the most popular techniques. This was first proposed by Viola and Jones in their original paper on rapid object detection, which uses a cascade of classifiers to detect features associated with faces. The Haar Cascade Classifier is pre-trained on large datasets of positive (images containing faces) and negative (images without faces) samples, hence it is able to correctly classify facial and non-facial regions in images.
