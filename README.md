  Face detection is one of the key applications of computer vision that allows machines to identify and locate human faces in images or video streams. This technology has been increasingly popular due to its application in security, social media, and human-computer interaction fields. Among the tools available for implementing face detection, OpenCV stands out as a robust and versatile library.
